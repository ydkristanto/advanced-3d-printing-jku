In grade 7, students learn how to formulate questions, collect data, present it, and analyze it to answer those questions. They also gain experience using bar charts and pie charts for data presentation and interpretation. In this lesson, students extend their understanding by representing real-world data in matrix form and visualizing it through 3D modeling and printing.\nIn Lesson 1, students will learn how to represent real-world data using matrices and interpret the information presented in matrix form. Through this process, they will develop skills in analyzing data representations, identifying key messages, and evaluating the effectiveness and efficiency of different representations. By the end of the lesson, students will have a deeper understanding of how matrices can be used to organize and convey data, and they will be introduced to matrices as a powerful tool for data representation.\nIn Lesson 2, students will learn how to represent data in a matrix format and then transform it into a 3D model using a 3D printer. They will start by visualizing the matrix data as a heatmap, and then use this heatmap to create a 3D model. Finally, students will print their 3D model using a 3D printer. Through this process, students will see how abstract matrix data can be brought to life in the physical world.\nIn Lesson 3, students will use real-world topographical data to create and print a physical model. They will start by using NASA Earth data to obtain an elevation matrix of a location of their choice. This data will then be modeled into a 3D representation, which students will print using a 3D printer. By the end of the lesson, students will have created a tangible topographical model from real-world elevation data.\n\n\nLearning Goals\nStudents will be able to represent real-world data (such as temperature or topography) in matrix form, interpret the data, and visualize it through 3D modeling and printing, converting abstract data into tangible models.\n\n\nRequired Materials\n\nComputers or tablets with R programming\nAccess to a 3D printer\nProjector and whiteboard\n\n\n\nRequired Preparation\n\nComputer with R Programming: Teachers will need a computer with R installed to assist students in converting the elevation matrix into a 3D model.

What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting and Redesigning Data Representations\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main message or insight about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020) as shown in Figure 1?\nDo you think the diagram effectively communicates this message? What could be improved?\nHow would you redesign this diagram to convey the same message more clearly or engagingly? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre You Ready for More?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a visual representation provided by your friend Alex as an alternative to convey the same message about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Alex’s work\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat patterns or trends can you observe in Alex’s visualization (Figure 2)?\nHow does this representation help convey the message compared to the original diagram?\nHow could you represent this figure more efficiently using only numbers? What would that look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding Data with Matrices\n\n\n\nThe matrix below shows the average temperature for each quarter at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park from 2016 to 2020. Each row corresponds to a year (2016–2020), and each column represents a quarter: Q1 (Jan–Mar), Q2 (Apr–Jun), Q3 (Jul–Sep), and Q4 (Oct–Dec).\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhat is the average temperature for the third quarter (Jul–Sep) of 2020?\nHow would you describe the trend in the average temperature throughout 2019?\nWhich year had the highest average temperature? Which year had the lowest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre You Ready for More?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer the third question, your friend Paulina created a new matrix that shows the average temperature for each year. The matrix is shown below. Can you explain in detail what she did to create this matrix?\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}25.56 \\\\25.08 \\\\25.27 \\\\25.63 \\\\25.52 \\\\\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nMatrices are powerful tools in mathematics that help us organize and represent data in a structured way. A matrix is simply a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It can be used to display various types of data, such as temperature, sales figures, or any other information that can be grouped into categories.\nFor example, you can use a matrix to represent temperature data. Let’s say we want to show the average temperature at a specific place throughout the year. Instead of writing down a long list of numbers, we can arrange the temperature data in a matrix. Each row could represent a year, and each column could represent a season or a specific time period, such as months or quarters.\nFor instance, the following matrix shows the average temperature at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park for each quarter of the year, from 2016 to 2020:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] In this matrix:\n\nThe rows represent the years (2016 to 2020).\nThe columns represent the quarters of the year (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec).\nThe numbers inside the matrix represent the average temperature for each quarter.\n\nUsing a matrix to represent temperature data makes it easier to analyze and spot patterns, such as trends in temperature over time or comparing different years and seasons. Matrices help us organize and interpret data more efficiently, providing clear insights into the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Matrix to 3D Visualization\nLet’s turn matrices into 3D models!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice and Wonder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatrix_example &lt;- matrix(\n  data = c(5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 10),\n  nrow = 3,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\nheatmap(\n  x = matrix_example,\n  Rowv = NA,\n  Colv = NA,\n  scale = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Matrices and Visualizing with Heatmaps\n\n\n\nUse the interactive code block below to create a matrix called matrix_example_2. Modify the values in the data, nrow, and byrow (TRUE or FALSE) arguments to explore their meanings. Click the “Run Code” button to see the results. Based on your exploration, what do you think each of these arguments does?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve created your matrix, use the code block below to generate a heatmap of matrix_example_2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the matrix values are represented in the heatmap. Experiment by changing the matrix values and regenerating the heatmap to see how it changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Real Data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling the World: Topography with Matrices\nLet’s bring matrices to life with 3D printing!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice and Wonder\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: konsepsi.wordpress.com\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Elevation Data Online\n\n\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a NASA mission that mapped the Earth’s surface to produce high-resolution elevation data. This data is invaluable for understanding topography and has wide-ranging applications, from environmental modeling and urban planning to disaster risk assessment. By representing elevation data in a matrix form, we can use mathematical tools to analyze and visualize terrains, making it easier to study and solve real-world problems.\n\nWhat type of information does the SRTM elevation data provide? How could it be used in real-world applications?\nExplore the Derek Watkins’ Tile Downloader website. How is the elevation data presented? What do “30-meter resolution” and “tile” mean?\nHow might the data from a single tile be represented as a matrix? What does each value in the matrix represent in terms of elevation?\nIf you wanted to use this data to create a physical 3D model, what steps would you take, starting from the downloaded data?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nElevating Data into 3D Models\n\n\n\n\nHow can elevation values in a matrix represent the physical features of a landscape?\nIf we visualize this matrix as a grid, how would the differences between adjacent elevation values appear in a 3D model?\nWhat steps are needed to turn a matrix of elevation data into a 3D model? Can you describe these steps in terms of inputs, processes, and outputs?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre You Ready for More?\n\n\n\n\n\nOne way to create a 3D model from elevation data is by using R programming with packages such as {rayshader}, {terra}, and {raster}. Below are the codes that will help you generate the 3D model of Mount Merapi.\n# Step 1\nlibrary(rayshader)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n# Step 2\nS08E110 &lt;- terra::rast(\"S08E110.hgt\")\nmerapi_boundaries &lt;- raster::extent(\n  110.3967, 110.4967,\n  -7.590278, -7.490278\n)\nmerapi_matrix &lt;- terra::crop(\n  x = S08E110,\n  y = merapi_boundaries\n) |&gt; \n  rayshader::raster_to_matrix()\n\n# Step 3\nmerapi_hillshade &lt;- sphere_shade(\n  heightmap = merapi_matrix\n)\nplot_3d(\n  hillshade = merapi_hillshade,\n  heightmap = merapi_matrix,\n  zscale = 30\n)\n\n# Step 4\nsave_3dprint(\n  filename = \"merapi_3d.stl\",\n  maxwidth = 150,\n  unit = \"mm\"\n)\n\nCan you explain what each step of the code does?\nWhat do you think the result of the code will look like? You can download the resulting STL file here. To view it, you can use an STL viewer, such as viewstl.com.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHello!"
