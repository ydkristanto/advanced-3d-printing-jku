What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInterpreting and Redesigning Data Representations\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main message or insight about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020) as shown in Figure 1?\nDo you think the diagram effectively communicates this message? What could be improved?\nHow would you redesign this diagram to convey the same message more clearly or engagingly? Why?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre You Ready for More?\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a visual representation provided by your friend Alex as an alternative to convey the same message about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Alex’s work\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat patterns or trends can you observe in Alex’s visualization (Figure 2)?\nHow does this representation help convey the message compared to the original diagram?\nHow could you represent this figure more efficiently using only numbers? What would that look like?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecoding Data with Matrices\n\n\n\nThe matrix below shows the average temperature for each quarter at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park from 2016 to 2020. Each row corresponds to a year (2016–2020), and each column represents a quarter: Q1 (Jan–Mar), Q2 (Apr–Jun), Q3 (Jul–Sep), and Q4 (Oct–Dec).\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhat is the average temperature for the third quarter (Jul–Sep) of 2020?\nHow would you describe the trend in the average temperature throughout 2019?\nWhich year had the highest average temperature? Which year had the lowest?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAre You Ready for More?\n\n\n\n\n\nTo answer the third question, your friend Paulina created a new matrix that shows the average temperature for each year. The matrix is shown below. Can you explain in detail what she did to create this matrix?\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}25.56 \\\\25.08 \\\\25.27 \\\\25.63 \\\\25.52 \\\\\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nMatrices are powerful tools in mathematics that help us organize and represent data in a structured way. A matrix is simply a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It can be used to display various types of data, such as temperature, sales figures, or any other information that can be grouped into categories.\nFor example, you can use a matrix to represent temperature data. Let’s say we want to show the average temperature at a specific place throughout the year. Instead of writing down a long list of numbers, we can arrange the temperature data in a matrix. Each row could represent a year, and each column could represent a season or a specific time period, such as months or quarters.\nFor instance, the following matrix shows the average temperature at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park for each quarter of the year, from 2016 to 2020:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] In this matrix:\n\nThe rows represent the years (2016 to 2020).\nThe columns represent the quarters of the year (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec).\nThe numbers inside the matrix represent the average temperature for each quarter.\n\nUsing a matrix to represent temperature data makes it easier to analyze and spot patterns, such as trends in temperature over time or comparing different years and seasons. Matrices help us organize and interpret data more efficiently, providing clear insights into the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary Entries\n\n\n\n\nData visualization\nThe process of turning numbers or information into pictures, graphs, or charts so that patterns and trends are easier to understand.\nHeatmap\nA type of chart that uses colors to show patterns in data. For example, warmer colors (like red or orange) can show higher values, and cooler colors (like blue) can show lower values.\nMatrix\nA grid of numbers organized in rows and columns, like a table, that helps us organize and analyze data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Numbers to Visualization: Exploring Matrices, Heatmaps, and 3D Models\nLet’s turn matrices into heatmaps and 3D models!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice and Wonder\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatrix_example &lt;- matrix(\n  data = c(5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 10),\n  nrow = 3,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\nheatmap(\n  x = matrix_example,\n  Rowv = NA,\n  Colv = NA,\n  scale = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Matrices and Visualizing with Heatmaps\n\n\n\nUse the interactive code block below to create a matrix called matrix_example_2. Modify the values in the data, nrow, and byrow (TRUE or FALSE) arguments to explore their meanings. Click the “Run Code” button to see the results. Based on your exploration, what do you think each of these arguments does?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve created your matrix, use the code block below to generate a heatmap of matrix_example_2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the matrix values are represented in the heatmap. Experiment by changing the matrix values and regenerating the heatmap to see how it changes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualizing Social Media Platform Overlaps\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the percentage of active users (age 16+) outside China who also use other social media platforms.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Social media platform audience overlaps.

Your result should look similar to the example shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A chessboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Data Representations: From Matrix to 3D Model\n\n\n\nHeatmaps are just one way to represent a matrix. We can also create a 3D model from a matrix. Below, you’ll find three representations of the same data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different representations of the same data\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast these three representations. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?\nNow, focus on the 3D visualization. How would you create such a 3D model starting with a matrix? Identify the steps or processes involved.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nHeatmaps and 3D visualizations are practical and engaging ways to represent data from matrices. A matrix, which is a structured grid of numbers organized in rows and columns, allows us to summarize and analyze data effectively. For instance, a heatmap can be used to visually represent the values in a matrix with color gradients, making patterns, overlaps, or trends easy to spot.\nImagine you’re analyzing social media usage overlaps, where each cell in the matrix represents the percentage of users shared between platforms. A heatmap of this matrix would use colors to highlight these overlaps, with stronger colors for higher percentages. Similarly, we can take this idea further by creating a 3D visualization, where the numbers in the matrix determine the height of each block in a 3D model.\nThrough this lesson, you saw how matrices can transform from abstract numbers into powerful visual tools. Heatmaps offer an intuitive way to see relationships at a glance, while 3D visualizations provide a tangible, spatial perspective on the same data. Together, these representations help uncover insights and bring data to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGlossary Entries\n\n\n\n\nmatrix() function\nThe matrix() function in R is used to create a matrix.

What do you wonder?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExploring Elevation Data Online\n\n\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a NASA mission that mapped the Earth’s surface to produce high-resolution elevation data. This data is invaluable for understanding topography and has wide-ranging applications, from environmental modeling and urban planning to disaster risk assessment.

Use the STL file from the previous activity to print the model using a 3D printer.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nMatrices are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing data in a structured way. By converting elevation data into a matrix, we can visualize topographic features like mountains and valleys. In this lesson, we used matrices to represent elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and then transformed that data into a 3D model, simulating the physical features of the Earth’s surface. For example, we modeled and 3D-printed a representation of Mount Merapi, a well-known active volcano in Indonesia.

    "text": "PreparationLesson 1Lesson 2Lesson 3Practice\n\n\n\nLesson Narrative\nThe lessons are based on three key principles: duality, necessity, and repeated reasoning. These principles help connect abstract mathematical ideas, like matrices, to the real world by integrating computational thinking and data visualization.\n\nDuality focuses on both mastering the subject, like using matrices to represent data, and building computational thinking skills.\nNecessity ensures the lessons spark students’ curiosity and need to learn matrices in a meaningful way.\nRepeated reasoning provides plenty of practice, helping students strengthen their computational thinking skills.\n\nTogether, these principles help students bridge the gap between abstract concepts and practical applications, giving them tools to better understand and model the world around them.\nThese lessons builds on concepts from previous units and introduces the matrix as a tool for data representation. In grade 7, students learn how to formulate questions, collect data, present it, and analyze it to answer those questions. They also gain experience using bar charts and pie charts for data presentation and interpretation. In this lesson, students extend their understanding by representing real-world data in matrix form and visualizing it through 3D modeling and printing.\nIn Lesson 1, students are introduced to the fundamentals of data visualization and matrix-based analysis. The tasks are carefully sequenced to build their understanding of how abstract data can be represented and interpreted using visual and numerical methods. The lesson begins with students observing and interpreting trends using visualizations, sparking their curiosity about temperature patterns. They then critically evaluate the effectiveness of a line chart, identifying its limitations and exploring improved methods of communication. Moving forward, students analyze heatmaps as an alternative visualization, comparing their effectiveness with line charts and learning to represent data as numerical matrices. Students engage with matrices to extract, interpret, and analyze numerical data, discovering how trends across rows or columns can reveal meaningful insights. To deepen their understanding, they practice summarizing data by reducing a matrix’s dimensionality through the calculation of averages. By the end of this lesson, students no longer see matrices as abstract arrays but as powerful tools for decoding and analyzing real-world data.\nIn Lesson 2, the foundational concepts of matrices and visualization are expanded through the integration of coding in R, enhancing students’ computational thinking. The tasks guide students to interact with code and matrices to create dynamic visualizations. Students start by exploring how simple R scripts generate heatmaps, learning how data structures relate to their visual representations. This introductory task helps students connect coding basics to data visualization. They then experiment with matrix parameters such as data, number of rows, and ordering methods, gaining hands-on experience in manipulating matrices and observing how changes affect visual outputs. Applying this knowledge, students work with real-world data, such as overlaps in social media platform usage, to create matrices and heatmaps that represent complex relationships. As they advance, students develop customized heatmaps, including a binary chessboard pattern, learning about color palettes and structured matrix designs. Finally, students transition from two-dimensional visualizations to the concept of three-dimensional data representation, exploring how matrix-based data can serve as the foundation for creating 3D models. This progression equips students with a deeper appreciation for the versatility of matrices in representing and visualizing diverse datasets.\nLesson 3 immerses students in the process of transforming elevation data into 3D models, combining data analysis, coding, and hands-on creation. The journey begins with students examining a 3D model of Mount Merapi, reflecting on how its visual representation connects to the underlying matrix-based data. This activity helps them grasp the concept of representing geographic information through three-dimensional visuals. Students then explore Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) elevation data, learning about data resolution and tiling while discovering its applications in urban planning and environmental modeling. Using this data, they analyze its structure as a matrix and transform it into a 3D model. This step helps them understand the relationship between numerical matrices and real-world landscapes. To advance their skills, students utilize R packages like rayshader and terra to work with geographic data and create detailed 3D models. They explore how coding allows them to manipulate data and visualize it effectively. The final step in this lesson is a tangible one—students 3D print their Mount Merapi models, experiencing the process of transforming digital data into physical objects. This hands-on conclusion bridges the gap between abstract data analysis and real-world applications, leaving students with a comprehensive understanding of data representation and its transformative potential.\n\n\nLearning Goals\nStudents will be able to represent real-world data (such as temperature or topography) in matrix form, interpret the data, and visualize it through 3D modeling and printing, converting abstract data into tangible models.\n\n\nRequired Materials\n\nComputers or tablets with R programming\nAccess to a 3D printer\nProjector and whiteboard\n\n\n\nRequired Preparation\n\nComputer with R Programming: Teachers will need a computer with R installed to assist students in converting the elevation matrix into a 3D model.

This task sets the stage for exploring mathematical representations in subsequent tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Understanding Yogyakarta’s temperature trends (2011–2020)\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nThings students may notice:\n\nEvery year has a similar pattern where the temperature decreases in the middle of the year and increases toward the end.\nSome years, like 2015 and 2016, seem to have higher peaks compared to others, but the general range of temperatures stays the same.\n\nThings students may wonder:\n\nI wonder if the changes in temperature are caused by seasonal differences or specific climate events.\nIs the average temperature increasing over the years, or is it just fluctuating randomly?\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task introduces students to interpreting graphical representations of data by encouraging them to observe and question trends in Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperatures from 2011 to 2020. It promotes curiosity and critical thinking as students engage in “noticing and wondering.” Teachers can use this task to assess students’ prior knowledge of data interpretation and spark discussions on patterns and anomalies in the data, laying the groundwork for deeper exploration of data visualization in subsequent tasks.\n\n\n\nTask 1.2: Interpreting and Redesigning Data Representations\nThe purpose of this task is to develop students’ critical thinking and data communication skills. Students will evaluate the effectiveness of a line chart for representing temperature trends, identify its limitations, and explore how to improve the visualization for clearer communication. This task serves as a stepping stone to introduce alternative representations, such as heatmaps, in the subsequent activity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\n\nWhat is the main message or insight about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020) as shown in Figure 1?\nDo you think the diagram effectively communicates this message? What could be improved?\nHow would you redesign this diagram to convey the same message more clearly or engagingly? Why?\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nWhat is the main message or insight about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020) as shown in the diagram?\n\n“The main message is that Yogyakarta has a consistent seasonal temperature trend, with warmest months in the middle of the year and cooler months at the start and end.”\n“The diagram highlights that, despite slight differences across years, the general monthly temperature trend is stable.”\n\nDo you think the diagram effectively communicates this message? What could be improved?\n\n“The diagram is clear, but separating the years into different graphs makes it harder to compare trends directly. A single graph might work better.”\n“The graphs are a bit overwhelming because there are so many of them. Maybe simplifying the layout or focusing on one aspect of the data could help.”\n\nHow would you redesign this diagram to convey the same message more clearly or engagingly? Why?\n\n“I would use one combined line chart with different colors for each year, so it’s easier to compare the trends in one place.”\n“I would group the years into smaller time periods, like five-year averages, to make the graph less cluttered.”\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task sets the stage for introducing heatmaps by encouraging students to critique and redesign data representations. Teachers should guide students to identify limitations in the original figure, such as difficulties in comparing trends across years, and prompt discussions on what makes data visualizations clear and engaging. By exploring different ways to simplify and enhance the communication of data trends, students begin to develop an awareness of how alternative visualizations, like heatmaps, can address these limitations. These discussions build a foundation for understanding the utility of heatmaps in the next task.\n\n\n\nTask 1.3: Are You Ready for More?\nThe purpose of this task is to help students analyze and interpret a heatmap as an alternative data visualization. Students will compare the heatmap with the original line charts, evaluate its advantages in communicating patterns and trends, and explore the idea of representing the data as a numerical matrix. This task builds understanding of heatmaps and lays the groundwork for introducing matrices as structured tools for numerical representation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nFigure 2 is a visual representation provided by your friend Alex as an alternative to convey the same message about Yogyakarta’s average monthly temperature (2011–2020).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Alex’s work\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat patterns or trends can you observe in Alex’s visualization (Figure 2)?\nHow does this representation help convey the message compared to the original diagram?\nHow could you represent this figure more efficiently using only numbers? What would that look like?\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nWhat patterns or trends can you observe in Alex’s visualization (Figure 2)?\n\n“I notice that the warmest months are in the middle of the year, and cooler months are at the beginning and end, which matches the seasonal trends from the line charts.”\n“The heatmap makes it easier to spot which years had slightly higher or lower average temperatures compared to others.”\n\nHow does this representation help convey the message compared to the original diagram?\n\n“The heatmap is less cluttered and lets you quickly see trends for all years at once without comparing multiple graphs.”\n“Using colors to represent temperature makes it easy to spot differences across years and months without looking at individual numbers.”\n\nHow could you represent this figure more efficiently using only numbers? What would that look like?\n\n“We could use a table with rows for years and columns for months, where each cell shows the average temperature.”\n“The data could be organized in a grid with numbers instead of colors, but it might be harder to spot patterns compared to the heatmap.”\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task introduces heatmaps as an alternative visualization, encouraging students to observe patterns and compare their effectiveness with previous representations. Teachers should guide students in identifying how heatmaps provide a more intuitive way to compare trends across years and months, emphasizing the compactness and clarity of this representation. Encourage students to reflect on how the use of color gradients highlights variations and supports quick pattern recognition. This discussion primes students for the next task, where they will connect heatmaps to matrices, reinforcing their understanding of how data can be effectively organized and visualized.\n\n\n\nTask 1.4: Decoding Data with Matrices\nThis task introduces students to using matrices to extract, interpret, and analyze numerical data. Students will develop the ability to locate specific data points in a matrix, describe trends across rows or columns, and compare data values to draw meaningful conclusions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nThe matrix below shows the average temperature for each quarter at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park from 2016 to 2020. Each row corresponds to a year (2016–2020), and each column represents a quarter: Q1 (Jan–Mar), Q2 (Apr–Jun), Q3 (Jul–Sep), and Q4 (Oct–Dec).\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\nWhat is the average temperature for the third quarter (Jul–Sep) of 2020?\nHow would you describe the trend in the average temperature throughout 2019?\nWhich year had the highest average temperature? Which year had the lowest?\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nWhat is the average temperature for the third quarter (Jul–Sep) of 2020?\n\n“The average temperature for Q3 of 2020 is 24.94°C.”\n“I found the value by looking at the last row (2020) and the third column (Q3).”\n\nHow would you describe the trend in the average temperature throughout 2019?\n\n“In 2019, the temperature increases from Q1 to Q3 and slightly decreases in Q4.”\n“The temperatures are lowest in Q1 and highest in Q3, showing a peak in mid-year.”\n\nWhich year had the highest average temperature? Which year had the lowest?\n\n“2019 had the highest average temperature, and 2017 had the lowest.”\n“I found the highest and lowest averages by summing each row and dividing by 4, then comparing the results.”\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task helps students practice interpreting matrices by locating specific data points, analyzing trends within a row, and comparing values across years. Teachers should ensure students understand how to navigate the matrix structure and encourage them to explain their reasoning. It’s important to connect the task to real-world applications, such as environmental data, and consider guiding students through any challenges with matrix navigation or comparison. For advanced learners, encourage exploring additional patterns or extending the matrix for further analysis.\n\n\n\nTask 1.5: Are You Ready for More?\nThis task aims to deepen students’ understanding of summarizing data by reducing a matrix’s dimensionality. Students analyze how averages are calculated across rows and learn to articulate data transformation processes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nTo answer the third question, your friend Paulina created a new matrix that shows the average temperature for each year. The matrix is shown below. Can you explain in detail what she did to create this matrix?\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}25.56 \\\\25.08 \\\\25.27 \\\\25.63 \\\\25.52 \\\\\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nWhat Paulina did:\n\n“Paulina added all the numbers in each row (each year) and then divided by 4 because there are 4 quarters.”\n“Paulina calculated the average temperature for each year by summing the temperatures of all four quarters in a row and dividing the total by the number of quarters (4). This reduced the matrix to one value per year.”\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task helps students connect mathematical operations (averaging) with real-world data transformations, fostering a deeper understanding of data simplification. Teachers should encourage students to focus on the reasoning behind summarizing data while reinforcing how such transformations maintain the essence of the original information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nMatrices are powerful tools in mathematics that help us organize and represent data in a structured way. A matrix is simply a grid of numbers arranged in rows and columns. It can be used to display various types of data, such as temperature, sales figures, or any other information that can be grouped into categories.\nFor example, you can use a matrix to represent temperature data. Let’s say we want to show the average temperature at a specific place throughout the year. Instead of writing down a long list of numbers, we can arrange the temperature data in a matrix. Each row could represent a year, and each column could represent a season or a specific time period, such as months or quarters.\nFor instance, the following matrix shows the average temperature at Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park for each quarter of the year, from 2016 to 2020:\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n26.12 & 25.73 & 25.03 & 25.36 \\\\\n25.03 & 24.68 & 24.48 & 26.15 \\\\\n24.90 & 25.10 & 24.64 & 26.45 \\\\\n25.40 & 24.71 & 24.65 & 27.78 \\\\\n26.01 & 25.21 & 24.94 & 25.95 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\] In this matrix:\n\nThe rows represent the years (2016 to 2020).\nThe columns represent the quarters of the year (Jan-Mar, Apr-Jun, Jul-Sep, Oct-Dec).\nThe numbers inside the matrix represent the average temperature for each quarter.\n\nUsing a matrix to represent temperature data makes it easier to analyze and spot patterns, such as trends in temperature over time or comparing different years and seasons. Matrices help us organize and interpret data more efficiently, providing clear insights into the information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFrom Numbers to Visualization: Exploring Matrices, Heatmaps, and 3D Models\nLearning Targets:\n\nStudents will be able to convert a matrix into a heatmap and interpret the data visualization.\nStudents will be able to compare matrices, heatmaps, and 3D models to understand how each represents data.\n\n\n\n\nTask 2.1: Notice and Wonder\nThe purpose of this task is to introduce students to the relationship between R code and the resulting heatmap. By analyzing a simple code example and the resulting heatmap, students will learn how data is structured in a matrix and how it is visually represented through a heatmap. This task serves as an introduction to the basics of coding and data visualization in R.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nmatrix_example &lt;- matrix(\n  data = c(5, 3, 1, 7, 4, 10),\n  nrow = 3,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\nheatmap(\n  x = matrix_example,\n  Rowv = NA,\n  Colv = NA,\n  scale = \"none\"\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nThings students may notice:\n\nAreas of the heatmap are shaded differently, with darker or lighter regions corresponding to higher or lower numbers in the matrix.\nThe matrix() function creates a matrix with values arranged in rows and columns. They could also notice that the heatmap() function is used to create a heatmap from a matrix.\n\nThings students may wonder:\n\nHow would changing the values in the matrix affect the heatmap’s color pattern?\nWhat would happen if we changed the Rowv, Colv, and scale parameters in the heatmap function? How would it impact the visual representation?\n\nTask Synthesis\nIn this task, students should connect the matrix values and the heatmap’s visual representation. Teachers should encourage them to focus on how the matrix values are mapped to color intensities in the heatmap and how the parameters in the heatmap() function (such as Rowv and Colv) affect the result. Teachers can guide students by asking questions like, “How do the colors in the heatmap relate to the numbers in the matrix?” or “What happens if we change the matrix values or the scaling in the code?” This task sets the stage for further exploration of more complex visualizations in R, helping students see how data can be represented in both matrix form and as a heatmap.\n\n\n\nTask 2.2: Exploring Matrices and Visualizing with Heatmaps\nThe purpose of this task is to deepen students’ understanding of how to manipulate matrices in R and how their changes affect the resulting heatmap visualization. By experimenting with matrix parameters such as data, nrow, and byrow, students will gain insights into how these parameters structure the matrix and how they influence the heatmap representation. The task provides an interactive, hands-on opportunity to learn about matrix construction and data visualization through heatmaps.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nUse the interactive code block below to create a matrix called matrix_example_2. Modify the values in the data, nrow, and byrow (TRUE or FALSE) arguments to explore their meanings. Click the “Run Code” button to see the results. Based on your exploration, what do you think each of these arguments does?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve created your matrix, use the code block below to generate a heatmap of matrix_example_2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nObserve how the matrix values are represented in the heatmap. Experiment by changing the matrix values and regenerating the heatmap to see how it changes.\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\n\nStudents may notice that changing the values in data directly alters the contents of the matrix. For example, if they change the values from c(6, 2, 4, 5, 6, 1, 3, 2) to another set of numbers, the matrix will display different values, which will be reflected in the heatmap.\nStudents will observe that modifying the nrow argument changes the number of rows in the matrix. For instance, if they set nrow to 2, the matrix will have only 2 rows, and the data will be reorganized accordingly.\nWhen students set byrow = TRUE, the matrix fills row by row. If they change it to FALSE, the matrix will fill column by column. Students should notice how this reordering of data affects both the matrix’s structure and the heatmap’s appearance.\n\nTask Synthesis\nIn this task, students are encouraged to experiment with modifying the matrix parameters and observe how these changes affect both the matrix and the heatmap. Teachers can facilitate the learning process by guiding students to ask questions such as “What happens when you change the number of rows?” or “How does changing byrow from TRUE to FALSE affect the arrangement of data in the matrix?” Teachers should encourage students to make connections between the matrix structure and how that structure is visually represented in the heatmap. Through experimentation, students will gain a deeper understanding of matrices, their construction, and how data can be visually represented using heatmaps.\n\n\n\nTask 2.3: Visualizing Social Media Platform Overlaps\nThe purpose of this task is to help students apply their understanding of matrices and heatmaps to a real-world data set, specifically focusing on social media platform overlaps. Through this task, students will learn how to create and manipulate matrices in R, assign appropriate row and column names, and visualize data using a heatmap. The goal is for students to connect the concept of matrix manipulation to visualizing complex relationships (such as overlaps in social media platform usage) and to understand how heatmaps can effectively represent this data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nTable 1 shows the percentage of active users (age 16+) outside China who also use other social media platforms.\n\n\n\nTable 1: Social media platform audience overlaps.

Teachers should emphasize the importance of understanding how matrix data corresponds to the layout of the heatmap, where the values in the matrix are represented by color gradients. It’s essential for students to grasp that the heatmap is a tool to visualize relationships between data points, in this case, the overlaps in social media usage. Teachers should encourage students to explore the heatmap, noticing how strong or weak overlaps are visually represented, and discuss how they might interpret these overlaps in terms of trends or patterns.\n\n\n\nTask 2.4: Are You Ready for More?\nThe goal of this task is to deepen students’ understanding of how to manipulate matrices and customize heatmaps using colors. By creating a chessboard pattern as a heatmap, students will learn how to represent binary data visually, adjust color schemes using colorRampPalette, and work with larger matrices to create more complex visualizations. This task builds on the previous ones by incorporating new elements like a custom color palette and a more structured matrix layout, helping students see how flexibility in visualization tools can be used to convey different types of data.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nTake a look at the code below and think about what it’s doing.\n\nmatrix_example_3 &lt;- matrix(\n  data = c(0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0),\n  nrow = 3,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\nred_blue &lt;- colorRampPalette(\n  colors = c(\"red\", \"blue\")\n)\n\nheatmap(\n  x = matrix_example_3,\n  Rowv = NA,\n  Colv = NA,\n  labRow = NA,\n  labCol = NA,\n  scale = \"none\",\n  col = red_blue(2)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow, using the idea from the previous code, create a chessboard pattern as a heatmap of a matrix! Your result should look similar to the example shown in Figure 3.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: A chessboard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\n\n# Creating the matrix\nmatrix_chessboard &lt;- matrix(\n  data = rep(c(rep(c(1, 0), 4), rep(c(0, 1), 4)), 4),\n  ncol = 8,\n  byrow = TRUE\n)\n\n# Customizing the color palette\nblack_white &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(\"white\", \"black\"))\n\n# Generating the heatmap\nheatmap(\n  x = matrix_chessboard,\n  Rowv = NA,\n  Colv = NA,\n  labRow = NA,\n  labCol = NA,\n  scale = \"none\",\n  col = black_white(2)\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task helps students practice matrix creation, color customization, and heatmap visualization. Teachers should guide students to understand how the matrix’s numeric values (1s and 0s) translate into visual data when used with the heatmap() function. If students struggle with manually creating the alternating binary pattern for the matrix, the rep() function can be introduced. The rep() function repeats elements in a vector and is helpful for creating the repeating 1s and 0s pattern in the matrix. For example, rep(c(1, 0), 4) repeats the sequence of 1, 0 four times. Teachers can explain how this can be extended to generate larger matrices for the chessboard-like pattern.\nEncourage students to experiment with different color schemes using colorRampPalette() to see how the heatmap appearance changes. Discuss how this task connects to real-world data visualization scenarios, where binary or categorical data are represented visually. After the task, students should be able to explain how their color choices and matrix structure influence the heatmap, and how the rep() function can be used to simplify creating repetitive numeric patterns in matrices.\n\n\n\nTask 2.5: Exploring Data Representations–From Matrix to 3D Model\nThe purpose of this task is to explore different data representations (matrix, heatmap, 3D model) and to help students understand how data can be visualized in various forms, each with its own advantages and limitations. The task also introduces students to the concept of creating 3D models based on matrices.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nHeatmaps are just one way to represent a matrix. We can also create a 3D model from a matrix. Below, you’ll find three representations of the same data:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHeatmap\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Different representations of the same data\n\n\n\n\nCompare and contrast these three representations. What are the strengths and weaknesses of each?\nNow, focus on the 3D visualization. How would you create such a 3D model starting with a matrix? Identify the steps or processes involved.\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\n\nComparison of representations: The matrix representation provides the raw data, which is useful for precise values, but it is hard to identify patterns or trends. The heatmap is easier to read visually because it uses colors to represent the data, making it easier to spot high and low values at a glance. However, it doesn’t show exact values, and the color scale might be misleading. The 3D model adds depth to the data, giving a clear sense of how the values change across the matrix. It’s more immersive and can highlight complex patterns, but it’s harder to interpret and requires more effort to create. Each representation has its strengths, but the choice depends on what aspect of the data you want to focus on—raw values, patterns, or relationships in three dimensions.\nCreating a 3D model: To create a 3D model from a matrix, we first need to assign each value in the matrix a position in 3D space, where the rows could represent the X-axis, the columns the Y-axis, and the values themselves the Z-axis. Then, using a tool we would plot these points in 3D space.\n\nTask Synthesis\nEncourage students to reflect on how each representation serves different purposes. The matrix is effective for showing raw data, but it may not be the most intuitive for understanding trends or patterns. The heatmap provides an accessible visual interpretation but may lack the depth that a 3D model offers. The 3D model is useful for showing more complex relationships but requires additional tools and understanding.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nHeatmaps and 3D visualizations are practical and engaging ways to represent data from matrices. A matrix, which is a structured grid of numbers organized in rows and columns, allows us to summarize and analyze data effectively. For instance, a heatmap can be used to visually represent the values in a matrix with color gradients, making patterns, overlaps, or trends easy to spot.\nImagine you’re analyzing social media usage overlaps, where each cell in the matrix represents the percentage of users shared between platforms. A heatmap of this matrix would use colors to highlight these overlaps, with stronger colors for higher percentages. Similarly, we can take this idea further by creating a 3D visualization, where the numbers in the matrix determine the height of each block in a 3D model.\nThrough this lesson, you saw how matrices can transform from abstract numbers into powerful visual tools. Heatmaps offer an intuitive way to see relationships at a glance, while 3D visualizations provide a tangible, spatial perspective on the same data. Together, these representations help uncover insights and bring data to life.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nModeling the World: Topography with Matrices\nLearning Targets:\n\nStudents will be able to use real-world topographical data (elevation matrix) to create a 3D model of a selected location.\nStudents will be able to print the 3D model using a 3D printer, turning abstract data into a physical representation.\n\n\n\n\nTask 3.1: Notice and Wonder\nThe purpose of this task is to encourage students to observe and reflect on the 3D model of Mount Merapi and make connections between the visual representation and the underlying data it represents. This will also help them understand how 3D models can be used to convey geographic and scientific information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImage: konsepsi.wordpress.com\n\n\nWhat do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nThings students may notice:\n\nThe model shows different elevations and varying terrain, indicating peaks and valleys on the mountain.\nThe 3D representation looks realistic, with detailed features like ridges and slopes.\n\nThings students may wonder:\n\nHow was this 3D model created? What kind of data was used to make the model?\nDoes this model show recent changes to Mount Merapi, like lava flow or eruptions?\nHow accurate is the model? Does it reflect the current state of the mountain?\nWhat kind of technology or tools were used to capture the mountain’s features and convert them into a 3D model?\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task helps students engage with the concept of 3D modeling by having them reflect on the visual features of the model and consider its real-world implications. Teachers should encourage students to explore how such models could be constructed, for example, using topographic maps or satellite data. Teachers can guide the discussion by asking students to think about how 3D models can help us understand and visualize complex geographic and scientific data.\n\n\n\nTask 3.2: Exploring Elevation Data Online\nThe purpose of this task is to introduce students to the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data and its representation as elevation data. Students will explore how the data is structured into tiles, understand the meaning of terms like “30-meter resolution,” and recognize how this data can be used for real-world applications like urban planning and environmental modeling. By considering the elevation data as a matrix, students will learn how to analyze and visualize terrain information.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nThe Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) was a NASA mission that mapped the Earth’s surface to produce high-resolution elevation data. This data is invaluable for understanding topography and has wide-ranging applications, from environmental modeling and urban planning to disaster risk assessment. By representing elevation data in a matrix form, we can use mathematical tools to analyze and visualize terrains, making it easier to study and solve real-world problems.\n\nWhat type of information does the SRTM elevation data provide? How could it be used in real-world applications?\nExplore the Derek Watkins’ Tile Downloader website. How is the elevation data presented? What do “30-meter resolution” and “tile” mean?\nHow might the data from a single tile be represented as a matrix? What does each value in the matrix represent in terms of elevation?\nIf you wanted to use this data to create a physical 3D model, what steps would you take, starting from the downloaded data?\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\nThe SRTM elevation data provides information about the height or elevation of the Earth’s surface, such as mountains, valleys, and flatlands. It can be used in urban planning, environmental modeling, disaster risk assessment, and infrastructure development. The data helps us understand the terrain and make informed decisions based on the landscape’s shape and features.\nThe elevation data on the Tile Downloader website is presented in “tiles,” which are sections of the Earth’s surface. Each tile contains elevation data for a specific geographic area. Users can download these tiles to work with the data for a particular region or project.\n“30-meter resolution” means that each data point represents a 30-meter by 30-meter area on the ground. This provides a relatively high level of detail for mapping and analyzing terrain features. A “tile” refers to a small section of the Earth’s surface, divided into manageable units for easier storage and processing.\nThe data from a single tile can be represented as a matrix with rows and columns, where each cell in the matrix corresponds to an elevation value at a specific point on the Earth’s surface. Each matrix value represents the height of the land at that specific location in the grid.\nTo create a physical 3D model, you would first download the elevation data for the region you’re interested in. Then, you would convert the matrix values into 3D coordinates, which represent the height of the terrain. After that, you could use 3D modeling software to generate a digital model, which can be printed using a 3D printer to create a physical model of the terrain.\nTask Synthesis\nTeachers should support students in connecting the SRTM data to real-world applications, emphasizing the significance of elevation data for terrain analysis. It’s important to guide students through understanding how the matrix structure works, where each cell corresponds to an elevation value and how these values represent physical geography. When discussing terms like “30-meter resolution” and “tile,” teachers should provide examples and visual aids to reinforce the concept of how data is broken into smaller, manageable sections for easier analysis.\n\n\n\nTask 3.3: Elevating Data into 3D Models\nThe purpose of this task is to help students understand how elevation data can be represented in a matrix and how such data can be used to create a 3D model of a landscape. It encourages students to explore the relationship between data in a matrix and its representation in the real world, particularly in terms of 3D visualizations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\n\nHow can elevation values in a matrix represent the physical features of a landscape?\nIf we visualize this matrix as a grid, how would the differences between adjacent elevation values appear in a 3D model?\nWhat steps are needed to turn a matrix of elevation data into a 3D model? Can you describe these steps in terms of inputs, processes, and outputs?\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\n\nElevation values in a matrix represent the height of the land at different points. If we think of the matrix as a map, each number tells us how high or low the land is at that spot. Higher numbers mean higher points, like mountains, and lower numbers mean lower points, like valleys or flat ground.\nIf we turn this matrix into a 3D model, the differences in elevation would look like bumps or dips on the land. If the numbers next to each other are very different, we’ll see a steep hill or valley. If they are similar, the land will look flat or gently sloping.\nFirst, we need the matrix, which has all the elevation numbers. Then, we use software to turn those numbers into a 3D shape, like a mountain or a plain. The process involves putting the matrix into the software, which reads the numbers and builds a model based on them. The output is a 3D map or model that shows how the land looks in real life.\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task helps students understand how mathematical data in the form of a matrix can represent real-world physical features like mountains, valleys, and flat land. Teachers should guide students to connect how the numbers in the matrix relate to changes in elevation on the land. If students struggle, they can explore software or tools that convert these matrices into 3D visualizations. Encourage them to think about how this data is used in the real world, such as for planning cities or understanding the environment.\n\n\n\nTask 3.4: Are You Ready for More?\nThe purpose of this task is to guide students through a more advanced application of elevation data to create 3D models using R programming. This task introduces students to the process of working with geographic data and visualization tools, using specific R packages like rayshader, terra, and raster. It encourages students to explore coding as a tool for transforming raw elevation data into 3D printed models.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nOne way to create a 3D model from elevation data is by using R programming with packages such as {rayshader}, {terra}, and {raster}. Below are the codes that will help you generate the 3D model of Mount Merapi.\n# Step 1\nlibrary(rayshader)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(raster)\n\n# Step 2\nS08E110 &lt;- terra::rast(\"S08E110.hgt\")\nmerapi_boundaries &lt;- raster::extent(\n  110.3967, 110.4967,\n  -7.590278, -7.490278\n)\nmerapi_matrix &lt;- terra::crop(\n  x = S08E110,\n  y = merapi_boundaries\n) |&gt; \n  rayshader::raster_to_matrix()\n\n# Step 3\nmerapi_hillshade &lt;- sphere_shade(\n  heightmap = merapi_matrix\n)\nplot_3d(\n  hillshade = merapi_hillshade,\n  heightmap = merapi_matrix,\n  zscale = 30\n)\n\n# Step 4\nsave_3dprint(\n  filename = \"merapi_3d.stl\",\n  maxwidth = 150,\n  unit = \"mm\"\n)\n\nCan you explain what each step of the code does?\nWhat do you think the result of the code will look like? You can download the resulting STL file here. To view it, you can use an STL viewer, such as viewstl.com.\n\n\n\nPossible Student Answers\n\nIn the code, the first step involves loading three essential R packages: rayshader, terra, and raster. The second step starts by loading the elevation data from a file (S08E110.hgt) using the terra::rast() function. The raster::extent() function defines the boundaries around Mount Merapi, focusing the analysis on this specific region. Then, the terra::crop() function is used to crop the elevation data to these boundaries, and rayshader::raster_to_matrix() converts the cropped data into a matrix, which is suitable for creating 3D visualizations. In the third step, the sphere_shade() function generates a 3D hillshade effect and the plot_3d() function is used to display the 3D model with exaggerated elevation changes (via the zscale = 30 parameter). Finally, in the fourth step, the 3D model is saved as an STL file using the save_3dprint() function.\nThe result will be a 3D model of Mount Merapi.\n\nTask Synthesis\nThis task provides an opportunity for students to learn how to transform geographical elevation data into a 3D model using R programming. Teachers should ensure that students understand the purpose of each step in the code and how the packages interact to produce the final output. If students struggle with the technical aspects of the code, guide them through the function calls and explain how the data flows from one step to the next. Emphasize the real-world application of this process, such as using 3D models in environmental studies or urban planning. Teachers can also suggest that students explore the STL file and try printing the 3D model to see how the code translates to a physical object.\n\n\n\nTask 3.5: 3D Printing the Model\nThe purpose of this task is to connect the virtual model of Mount Merapi created from elevation data with the physical world by printing the 3D model using a 3D printer. This task allows students to understand the final step in the 3D model creation process and experience how digital data can be transformed into a tangible object.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStudent Facing\n\n\n\nLet’s print the 3D model! Use the STL file from the previous activity to print the model using a 3D printer.\n\n\nTask Synthesis\nTeachers should guide students through the steps of 3D printing, emphasizing the importance of preparing the STL file and checking it in the printer software to avoid issues during printing. Students should understand the significance of selecting the correct settings for materials and print quality. Teachers can also explain how 3D models like this can enhance learning by providing a physical representation of complex concepts, like terrain and elevation. After the printing process, it would be useful to discuss the differences between digital models and physical objects, encouraging students to think critically about how technology transforms data into something they can touch and analyze.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSummary\n\n\n\nMatrices are a powerful tool for representing and analyzing data in a structured way. By converting elevation data into a matrix, we can visualize topographic features like mountains and valleys. In this lesson, we used matrices to represent elevation data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM), and then transformed that data into a 3D model, simulating the physical features of the Earth’s surface. For example, we modeled and 3D-printed a representation of Mount Merapi, a well-known active volcano in Indonesia. The outcome of this process is shown in Figure 5.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D model of Mount Merapi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3D printed model of Mount Merapi\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: 3D model and 3D printed model of Mount Merapi, created from elevation data, showcasing the transformation from digital representation to physical model.\n\n\n\nThis exercise helps us see how abstract data can be turned into meaningful, real-world representations, such as terrain models, and how mathematics can be applied to understand and visualize landscapes. Through this lesson, you learned how matrices can be used to model topography and how 3D printing brings these models\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmma wants to know the prices of iPhones on Amazon.
