The development of these lessons and task sequences was guided by original ideas and content created by me, the author. While I used AI tools, specifically ChatGPT, to assist in refining the language to ensure the materials are appropriate for the target audience—teachers (for teacher materials) or students (for student materials)—I have personally reviewed and verified all content.
